# The Deviation Tutorial

This tutorial will guide you through the concepts of
the Deviation Programming Language. Knowing Javascript or Python is helpful,
but having a programming background is not required to follow through the tutorial.

## About the Tutorial
### Layout
If you are reading this on a computer:
- the instructions are on the left,
- the editor is on the right

If you are reading this on a phone:
- the instructions are on the top
- the editor is on the bottom

Editor operation buttons are above the editor, the output is below the editor.

Scroll to the bottom of the instruction to navigate through the pages.

### Style
The tutorial behaves more like a guided playground than a typical coding tutorial. It does not record your progress, nor does it have any compulsory questions and tasks. There will be some challenging but fun task at the end of each topic, but the completion of that is up to you. 

### Code Snippets
These are snippets of example devia code blocks. They are readonly and can't be changed. Comments are sentences starting with a #, they are ignored in the program as well.
```
a = 1 * 1
b = func(x) x * x
# i am ignored
```
 
## Preface
This tutorial is of a programming language called Deviation. This is a project for the IB diploma, which needed some global engagement hence the existence of this website. The source code for the programming language is [here](https://github.com/Troppydash/plang-interpreter) at your interest.

*This tutorial is written entirely in the deviation programming language itself, and I think that is pretty cool!*
