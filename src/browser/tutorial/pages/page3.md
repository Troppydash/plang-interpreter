# Variables and Data Type

### Data Types
A computer at its simplest is a state machine, in that it have a state, and is running instructions that changes the state. These states are represented in memory as 1s and 0s, but Devia have some nicer **Data Type** that does the same trick. 

```
123   # Num
true  # Bool
"Hi"  # Str
null  # Null
Str   # Type
```

The five main data types: Numbers, Booleans, Strings, Null, Type, and examples of usage of them are shown in the code block above. 

In more detail:
- 123 is a number, 
- true/false are booleans, 
- an English sentence surrounded by "" is a string, 
- null is an empty value,
- and any data type is a type.

### Variables
Variables are names for Data Types. Instead of using long and hard to remember hexadecimal memory locations to find our data, we can use plain English instead.

```
weekdays = 7
```

This program says that the word **weekdays** is the number 7, simple as that.

### Challenges
1. Assign your favorite number to a variable named **favnum**.
2. What does **true** and **false** mean? Think about ways that they can be used.
