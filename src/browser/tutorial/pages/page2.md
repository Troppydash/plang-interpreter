If you already have some experience with programming, feel free to skip this section, but stay if you are curious.


### Programming
Programming is the art of talking to a machine, forcing it to follow instructions that you've given. While hexadecimal codes were the thing 30 years ago, there are several programming languages today that allows even young children to control their computers.

Writing a program shouldn't be hard. Although the fancy symbols and syntax highlighting seems difficult and complex, they are here to help you. Have a go, think about what the program in the editor does, and press **Run** to verify its behavior.

The Deviation Programming Language is designed with simplicity in mind. Thou powerful enough for common everyday use, one would need to pick up a more advance programming language sometime later. Devia allows this transition by allowing Javascript to *talk* with your Devia program, without needing to re-write your existing functions and code.

 With an open-mind, continue to the next section.
